There is a need for a simpler way to make graphic for restaurant ouners. It would be great if manager could take a picture, add words and publish an ad or coupon. Tap & Fork offers a simple editor to create ads and coupons for restaurant owners as a part of website application. It is a key fiture of the whole project to have an easy-to-use web based graphic editor. This editor helped to create create custom images and restaurant owners were able to control time intervals and image gallery of their profile.<br/>\n        The idea was:\n        <ul>\n          <li>Allow restaurant owners to control all of the information about their business directly on the application.</li>\n          <li>Allow restaurants to publish coupons, specials, and events as well as promote new things on the menu without any design services.</li>\n          <li>Publish new photos and manage the published ones.</li>\n        </ul>\n        </Typography>\n        <Typography className={text.paragraph}>\n        <b>My role in this project</b> - UX and Graphic design of the application\n        </Typography>\n        <Typography variant=\"h6\" align=\"left\" color=\"primary\">\n          Desk research:\n          </Typography>\n          <Typography className={text.paragraph}>\n          I analyzed different mobile and web applications for graphic editing. I aimd for solutions that can be used without training for a customer who is not familiar with the graphic creation process.<br/>\n          UI is only intuitive for a specific group of people. The average user, however, is not very comfortable with graphics. I therefore decided not to use popular elements in graphic editors, but rather opt for the simple left-to-right construction and logic.\n          </Typography>\n          <Typography className={text.paragraph}>\n          I created 4 user personas for the ad builder. Personas help us visualize how many different perspectives we can reach. It is not about percentage and statistics it is about points of view and difficalies customers could have. There are more staff members than owners. It is important to identify who will be working with this application in real life situations.The needs and circumstances of a business owner may greatly vary. With this in mind, I created four personas.<br/>\n          <ul>\n            <li>owner interested in IT who keep up with the latest innovations and technologies</li>\n            <li>owner with little experience in IT</li>\n            <li>manager, with some experience in social media and MS Office</li>\n            <li>young waitress, who uses her phone a lot</li>\n          </ul><br/>\n          Analizing the needs and requierment these users would have for the editor I created the minimum functionality list:\n          <ul>\n            <li>Basic functions (create, modify and delete objects)</li>\n            <li>Image gallery (ready-to-use clip art)</li>\n            <li>Upload images and logos</li>\n            <li>Simple text editing</li>\n            <li>Shapes for highlighting</li>\n          </ul>\n          <img src={moskup} align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"App on mobile\" />\n            </Typography>\n          \n          <Typography variant=\"h6\" align=\"left\" color=\"primary\">\n            User testing:\n          </Typography>\n          <Typography className={text.paragraph}>\n            We had a simplified user testing. Random people in a restaurant were asked to create something for a free beer. The results were both interesting and disheartening. Two people found the creative process addictive. Three users didn’t know where to start. Most could make letters on a background. This illustrated the application’s need for a more intuitive design process for the average user.\n              <b>Improvements after user testing:</b>\n              <ul>\n                <li>I designed a wizard to make step-by-step flow. The process became much easier to start and all the way till the end.</li>\n                <li>The best decision was to create templates. People could customize templates with their images just fine!</li>\n              </ul>\n                  \n\n\n\n           A teem member contacted 20 restaurant owners. After that we could state goals and pain points for both restaurant customers and restaurant owners. \n           </Typography>\n           <Typography className={text.paragraph}>\n           Restaurant customers objectives:\n            <ul>\n              <li>Find a restaurants of preferred type and distance</li>\n              <li>Get coupons and specials</li>\n              <li>Call to make reservation</li>\n              <li>Directions</li>\n              <li>Save for future visits</li>\n            </ul>\n          </Typography>\n          <Typography className={text.paragraph}>\n          Restaurant owners needs:\n            <ul>\n              <li>Affordable branding and listings</li>\n              <li>Advertising through coupons and specials</li>\n              <li>Easily publish new images</li>\n              <li>Control promotion time windows</li>\n            </ul>\n          </Typography>\n          <Typography className={text.paragraph}>\n            As a result we decided on this functionality list:\n            <ul>\n              <li>Search for distance, cuisine type, and keywords</li>\n              <li>Listing of graphic ads</li>\n              <li>Call and direction buttons</li>\n              <li>Gallery for each restaurant</li>\n              <li>Star rating</li>\n              <li>Favorites </li>\n              <li>Sample placeholders and Google images for non-subscribed restaurants</li>\n            </ul>\n          </Typography>\n          <Typography className={text.paragraph}>\n           I could create user personas and coordinate ui with different scenarios of app users. A symple flowchart was created as a result:\n           </Typography>\n           </Container> \n           <Container maxWidth=\"lg\" component=\"footer\">\n                   <img src={tfflow} align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"App on mobile\" />\n          </Container> \n          <Container maxWidth=\"md\" component=\"footer\">\n          <Typography className={text.paragraph}>\n           Search result can be displayed as list. For the pupose of this aplikation and for better user experience I wanted to use cards with graphic. I think it is optimal to have 4 cards per screen and make them tall. It give an oppotunity for clear headder with name and stars. Images of food looked so much better and more destinguisheble then in other apps.\n          </Typography>\n          <Typography className={text.paragraph}>\n           Espesially big problem with the design was the initial state of the app. Where the images and restaurants would come from? How the app should look when it is just starting? The solution was to use googl data and preset images for certan types of restaurants. As a result the app was beautiful and addictive to scroll even when it just came alive.\n          </Typography>\n          <br/>\n          <img src={tfscreens} align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"App on mobile\" />\n          <br/> <br/>\n          \n          <Typography variant=\"h6\" align=\"left\">\n          <br/>\n          I'm particularly proud of some contrebutions I made to this project:\n          </Typography>\n          <Typography className={text.paragraph}>\n            <ul>\n              <li>Google data is used before restaurants customize their business account </li>\n              <li>Beautifull images</li>\n              <li>The ability to have 4 restaurants on one mobile screen.
