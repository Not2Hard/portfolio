There are several recipe manager apps (Copy me That recipe manager, Recipe Keeper, Favorite Recipes ). For comunication and classes people use other apps MeetUp and Fasebook. \n                   <br />\n                   <b>User research</b> had a very brif form. I asked questions to my fiends from other countries. I know that there were cooking classes about healthy recipes in our area. It was organised using Facebook and text masages. It would take some effords to make people use a seporate app for this pupouse. May be if the app would offer an authentic experiense of nowing somebody how is living a world away and promise some adanture and health benifits. \n                   <br />\n                   <b>Personas</b> creation had a brif form too. I made two of them. One is yang men and older women. Women would like to be useful and would like to teach classes. Yang men would like to have a reason to go out and meet other people. I made a list of thier tasks and what they have to see in the app to find it interesting. Looking at personas helps to create <b>user flow:</b>\n                   <a href='/ref_flow.pdf' target=\"_blank\"><img src={flow} align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"App on mobile\" /></a>\n                   <br />\n                   <b>Wireframes</b> is a natural next step. Every funstion on the flow chart has at least one UI element for user to see. The order and different kinds where choosen by industry standarts. What make it easy for user to understand and easy for developers to create as it was all seen before. \n                   <a href={mosk} target=\"_blank\"><img src={mosk} align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"App on mobile\" /></a>\n                  </Typography>\n                  <img src={signin} align=\"center\" width=\"20%\" alt=\"App on mobile\" />\n                  <img src={ui1} align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"App on mobile\" />\n                  <img src={ui2} align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"App on mobile\" />\n                  \n                  \n          \n           \n            <Typography variant=\"h4\" align=\"left\">\n                  My role in this project\n                </Typography>\n           \n            \n                <Typography variant=\"h5\" align=\"left\">\n                UX and Graphic design for the application\n                </Typography>\n                <br/>\n                <Typography className={text.paragraph}>\n                Design brief from briefbox.me:\n                This startup company was started as the owner saw a need to help refugees integrate into the community, as so many are very isolated. After working with so many refugees the owner realised that most people had a real passion for food so this series of classes was born. They need your help designing an app directory for all the classes that are being held over the next few months. Include information about the person hosting the class, what dishes they’ll be teaching and another screen for information on their home country.\n                </Typography>\n                <br/> <br/>\n               \n                  \n               \n              </Grid>   \n             \n          \n        </Container> \n        \n        </div>  \n        <div  className={classes.backgr}> <img src={signin} align=\"center\" width=\"20%\" alt=\"App on mobile\" /></div>   \n    </div>\n    );\n  }\n\n  Refugee.propTypes = {\n    t: PropTypes.func.isRequired\n  };\n  \n  export default withTranslation(['profile-landing'])(Refugee);"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
