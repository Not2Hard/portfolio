Images of food looked so much better and more destinguisheble then in other apps.\n          </Typography>\n          <Typography className={text.paragraph}>\n           Espesially big problem with the design was the initial state of the app. Where the images and restaurants would come from? How the app should look when it is just starting? The solution was to use googl data and preset images for certan types of restaurants. As a result the app was beautiful and addictive to scroll even when it just came alive.\n          </Typography>\n          <br/>\n          <img src={tfscreens} align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"App on mobile\" />\n          <br/> <br/>\n          \n          <Typography variant=\"h6\" align=\"left\">\n          <br/>\n          I'm particularly proud of some contrebutions I made to this project:\n          </Typography>\n          <Typography className={text.paragraph}>\n            <ul>\n              <li>Google data is used before restaurants customize their business account </li>\n              <li>Beautifull images</li>\n              <li>The ability to have 4 restaurants on one mobile screen.
