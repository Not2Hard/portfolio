              <Typography className={text.paragraph}>
              This startup company was created when the founder saw a need to help refugees integrate into their community. Many people feel very isolated in a new place. After working with so many refugees the owner realised that most people had a real passion for food so this series of classes was born. Briefbox.me published the request for design of a directory app. The app should include information about the person hosting the class, what dishes theyâ€™ll be teaching and another screen for information on their home country.

              <Typography className={text.paragraph}>
              I started with looking up what is already in the App Store and Google Play. There are several recipe manager apps (Copy me That recipe manager, Recipe Keeper, Favorite Recipes ). For communication and classes people use other apps MeetUp and Facebook.

              <Typography className={text.paragraph}>
              I know that there were cooking classes about healthy recipes in our area. It was organised using Facebook and text messages. It would take some efforts to make people use an app dedicated for only one purpose. This app needs to be simple and give a strong feeling of connection to real people in the real world.

              <Typography className={text.paragraph}>
              It was a brief project. Personas help to prioritize functions and help create thoughtful user-centered design. My personas for this project were: a young man and a woman over 50. She would like to teach classes, while the yang man would like a reason to go out and meet other people. I made a list of their tasks and what they have to see in the app to enjoy it. Looking at personas helps to create flowchart:

              <Typography className={text.paragraph}>
              Every function on the flow chart has at least one UI element for the user to see. The order and different kinds were chosen by industry standards. What makes it easy for users to understand and easy for developers to create as it was all seen before.
