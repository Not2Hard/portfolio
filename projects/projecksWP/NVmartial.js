          New school of martial arts was opening in Dallas, GA. <br/>
          Owner objectives:
          <ul>
                <li>To be within 1-5 in Google or Martial Arts Acworth GA, Martial Arts Dallas GA, and Martial Arts Kennesaw GA</li>
                <li>Create a unique and successful brand</li>
                <li>Have one place for all info about classes</li>
                <li>Create a simple signup and payment process online</li>
              </ul>

          <Typography className={text.paragraph}>
            <b>My role in this project</b> - I was hired to create a branding, website and give some essential graphics support.

          Desk research:
          </Typography>
          <Typography className={text.paragraph}>
          I made a detailed analysis of existing martial arts schools in Dalas and Acworth, GA. Most successful businesses were using industry specialized marketing companies. The targeted auditory was parents looking for kids classes and adult weight loss programs.

          <Typography className={text.paragraph}>
          I like to start with search engine optimization. Google Ads Keyword Planner helps to see what words people use to find businesses. I made a list of the most popular keywords, found businesses that take first 2 places on each word or phrase. I made sure that I use all the winning techniques.
            <br/><br/>
          The owner agreed to choose a name for the business considering available domains with the best search words. It was a combination with his vision and available domains. His idea was to organize the school in an untraditional way, so he chose New Vision Martial Arts. We could purchase a great domain : nv-martialarts.com. It gave him a lot of advantages later on.

          User research:
          </Typography>
          <Typography className={text.paragraph}>
          I asked the opinions of 4 teenagers, 3 kids, 3 mothers and 2 fathers about the name of the business and chosen graphics styles. It helped to keep focus on different perspectives of different users.<br/><br/>
          This list of customer goals is the result of user research:
          <ul>
                <li>Look up good classes in their area</li>
                <li>See if they like the teachers and atmosphere of the club</li>
                <li>Find a good time in their schedule</li>
                <li>Find out the price and compare programs</li>
                <li>Signup for a free class</li>
                <li>Ask questions</li>
                <li>Pay online</li>

          Branding:

          <Typography className={text.paragraph}>
          It was important to translate the personality of the teacher and his talent to work with teenagers and kids. He has a recognizable good kick so I traced a photo of his cick into the logo and added some brite non traditional details.

              This logo was developed with a variant that is good for one and two color printing in a traditional looking way. The owner likes to use them all. <br/><br/>

          WordPress theme:

          <Typography className={text.paragraph}>
          One of the weaknesses of a website made on WordPress is performance. When starting a new project I like to check the chosen theme for speed loading with the simple content. If developers canâ€™t make the theme load fast it means I would have even less chances to do it without extra investments. <br/><br/>
          The website was hosted on a budget hosting account, but it has staging, two ways backup and saves information from form submission. WordPress can give some very specific trubbles in those areas.

          A new business needs at least basic promotional materials. To attract attention on the shopping plaza window decorations and "A" stand. To spread the word in printed catalogs a full page add. <br/><br/>

          This business flourishes. It opened 1 year before the pandemic and it survives the dificalies. There are plans about remodeling the website and moving to a different location. Nothing stands still for too long, but the owner created the school of his dream and he keeps recommending my service to others.
